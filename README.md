### Other Custom Features

This addon is highly modular and it allows to define a lot of custom behaviours for any profession. As an example, when using Beast Training with an active pet the portrait will change to the icon of the pet's family and the tooltip will display the pet's unit tooltip. The right drop down menu also will change to highlight the family of your active pet. Filters are also customized for Beast Training.
